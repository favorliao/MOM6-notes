1. variable related with light is called "*irr*" in COBALT
2. carbon is balanced by three variables in long-term run: dic_stf+runoff_flux_dic=fcased_burial

### river input
The NO3, ldon, sldon, srdon, ndet, po4, ldop, sldop, srdop are from Global NEWS data.   
The river DIC and Alk are fixed concentration which are 0.24e-3 and 0.48e-3 mol/kg respectively.  
The reason for the 1:2 ratio can be refered in book: Sarmiento, J. L., & Gruber, N. (2006). Ocean biogeochemical dynamics. Princeton University Press.
Should be careful with the DIC and Alk values here, it influence long-term global carbon budget
There is no DOC input for COBALT.
